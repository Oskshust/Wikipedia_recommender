Jugantar Patrika,"jugantar patrika (bengali: যুগান্তর) was a bengali revolutionary newspaper founded in 1906 in calcutta by barindra kumar ghosh, abhinash bhattacharya and bhupendranath dutt. a political weekly, it was founded in march 1906 and served as the propaganda organ for the nascent revolutionary organisation anushilan samiti that was taking shape in bengal at the time. the journal derived its name 'jugantar' (lit.: new era) from a political novel of the same name by bengali author shivnath shastri. the journal went on to lend its name to the western bengal wing of the anushilan samiti, which came to be known as the jugantar group. the journal expounded and justified revolutionary violence against the british raj as a political tool for independence, and denounced the right and legitimacy of the british rule in india. it was also critical of the indian national congress and its moderate methods which was viewed as aiding the raj.  its target audience was the young, literate and politically motivated youth of bengal, and was priced at one paisa. 
the paper rapidly acquired a broad popularity, at one time having a readership of 20,000. bhupendranath dutt served as the editor of the newspaper till his arrest in 1907, although it also published articles from a number of noted bengali revolutionaries including barindra kumar ghosh and aurobindo ghosh. it faced prosecution a number of times by the british indian government for publishing seditious articles. bhupendranath dutt was arrested in 1907 for publication of articles ""inciting violence against the government of india"", for which he was sentenced to a year's rigorous imprisonment. the paper was ultimately forced to shut down in down in 1908, amidst financial ruins following the prosecutions, and after the passage of the newspapers (incitement to offences) act in june 1908 which made its position vulnerable.",Abhinash Bhattacharya|Abhinav Bharat Society|Abinash Chandra Bhattacharya|Ajoy Ghosh|Alipore Bomb case|Alluri Sitarama Raju|Ambika Chakrabarty|Anant Laxman Kanhere|Ananta Singh|Anantahari Mitra|Anarchism in Bangladesh|Andrew Fraser (civil servant)|Annie Larsen affair|Anushilan Samiti|Ashfaqulla Khan|Atul Krishna Ghosh|Atulkrishna Ghosh|Aurobindo Ghosh|Badal Gupta|Bagha Jatin|Baikuntha Shukla|Bande Mataram (Paris publication)|Bande Mataram (publication)|Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Banwari Lal (revolutionary)|Barindra Kumar Ghosh|Barisal Conspiracy Case|Basanta Kumar Biswas|Basawon Singh|Batukeshwar Dutt|Bengal Volunteers|Bengali language|Benoy Basu|Berlin Committee|Bhagat Singh|Bhagwan Singh Gyanee|Bhagwati Charan Vohra|Bhai Balmukund|Bhai Parmanand|Bhavabhushan Mitra|Bhikaiji Cama|Bhupendra Kumar Datta|Bhupendranath Datta|Bhupendranath Dutt|Bina Das|Binod Bihari Chowdhury|Bipin Behari Ganguli|Bipin Chandra Pal|British Raj|Chandra Shekhar Azad|Charles Stevenson-Moore|Chempakaraman Pillai|Chittagong Armoury Raid|Chittagong armoury raid|Chittapriya Ray Chaudhuri|Chittaranjan Das|Christmas Day Plot|Communist Consolidation|Deba Gupta|Delhi Conspiracy Commission|Delhi conspiracy case|Department of Criminal Intelligence|Dhaka Anushilan Samiti|Dinesh Gupta|Durgawati Devi|Emperor vs Aurobindo Ghosh and others|Ganesh Damodar Savarkar|Ganesh Ghosh|Gaya Prasad Katiyar|Ghadar Mutiny|Ghadar Party|Gulab Kaur|Guran Ditt Kumar|Har Dayal|Hare Krishna Konar|Hari Kishan Talwar|Haridas Dutta|Harigopal Bal|Harnam Singh Saini|Harold Stuart|Hemchandra Kanungo|Hemu Kalani|Hindustan Ghadar|Hindustan Socialist Republican Association|Hindu–German Conspiracy|Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial|History of the Anushilan Samiti|Howrah-Sibpur Conspiracy case|India House|Indian National Congress|Indian nationalism|Jadugopal Mukherjee|Jatindra Nath Das|Jiban Ghoshal|Jnanendra Das Gupta|Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee|John Wallinger|Jugantar|Jugantar group|Kakori conspiracy|Kalpana Datta|Kalyani Das|Kanailal Dutta|Kartar Singh Sarabha|Khudiram Bose|Kishori Lal|Krishnaji Gopal Karve|Kunwar Pratap Singh Barhath|Kushal Konwar|Lahore Conspiracy Case trial|Lokenath Bal|M.
